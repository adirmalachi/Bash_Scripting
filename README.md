NETWORK RESEARCH:

This project entails setting up a system that initiates with the installation of required applications, ensuring avoidance of repeated installations. It performs an anonymity check of the network connection, alerting if non-anonymous, and revealing the spoofed country name if anonymous. It also accepts user-specified scan targets. Furthermore, the system can establish a remote SSH connection to retrieve server details and execute commands such as Whois and open port scans. Finally, it saves the gathered data into local files and maintains a log for auditing data collection activities.







PENETRATION TESTING:

This project involves creating a script for comprehensive network device mapping, identifying ports, services, and vulnerabilities. The user defines the network range, after which the program deploys tools like nmap and masscan for scanning and mapping purposes, storing the data in a newly created directory. The script also probes for network vulnerabilities, employing nmap, searchsploit, hydra, and medusa to identify security gaps, such as weak passwords. Finally, the scan summary and findings are presented to the user.





WINDOWS FORENSICS:
This project involved the creation of a comprehensive program for digital forensic analysis. Focused on automated hard disk drive (HDD) and memory investigations, it was designed to identify, extract, and display crucial data elements like network traffic or human-readable information. Additionally, the program integrates with the Volatility software for in-depth memory analysis and outputs detailed reports. It also features a dedicated function to install necessary forensic tools, ensuring smooth operation.





SOC ANALYST (DOMAIN MAPPER):

This project centers on developing a system that facilitates different types of network attacks for cybersecurity testing purposes. The system can generate three distinct types of attacks, each of which has a detailed description for user comprehension. It scans and displays network IP addresses and a list of possible attack methods. Users can select a specific or random attack and choose a target from the discovered IPs. The system logs every attack choice, including the type of attack, execution time, and target IP, stored in a log file at /var/log
